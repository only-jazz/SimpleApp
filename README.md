# Node.js - Demo Web Application
This is a simple Node.js web app using the Express framework and EJS templates. 

The app has been designed with cloud native demos & containers in mind, in order to provide a real working application for deployment, something more than "hello-world" but with the minimum of pre-reqs. It is not intended as a complete example of a fully functioning architecture or complex software design.

Typical uses would be deployment to Kubernetes, demos of Docker, CI/CD (build pipelines are provided), deployment to cloud (Azure) monitoring, auto-scaling

The app has several basic pages accessed from the top navigation menu, some of which are only lit up when certain configuration variables are set (see 'Optional Features' below):

- **'Info'** - Will show system & runtime information, and will also display if the app is running from within a Docker container and Kubernetes.  
- **'Tools'** - Some tools useful in demos, such a forcing CPU load (for autoscale demos), and error/exception pages for use with App Insights or other monitoring tool.
- **'Monitor'** - Display realtime monitoring data, showing memory usage/total and process CPU load.
- **'Weather'** - (Optional) Gets the location of the client page (with HTML5 Geolocation). The resulting location is used to fetch a weather forecast from the [Dark Sky](http://darksky.net) weather API
- **'Todo'** - (Optional) This is a small todo/task-list app which uses MongoDB as a database.
- **'User Account'** - (Optional) When configured with Azure AD (application client id and secret) user login button will be enabled, and an user-account details page enabled, which calls the Microsoft Graph API

# Running Locally 
Standard Node.js `npm install` and start with `npm start` from the 'src' directory. Web app will be listening on the usual Express port of 3000, but this can be changed by setting the `PORT` environmental variable. Tested with Node v8.x and 10.x


# Docker 
Public Docker image is [available on GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/users/benc-uk/packages/container/package/nodejs-demoapp).  

Run in a container with:
```
docker run --rm -it -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/benc-uk/nodejs-demoapp:latest
```

Should you want to build your own container, use the `Dockerfile` at the root of the project


# GitHub Actions CI/CD 
A working set of CI and CD release GitHub Actions workflows are provided `.github/workflows/`, automated builds are run in GitHub hosted runners

# Optional Features
The app will start up and run with zero configuration, however the only features that will be available will be the INFO and TOOLS views. The following optional features can be enabled:

### Application Insights 
Enable this by setting `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` 

The app has been instrumented with the Application Insights SDK, it will however need to be configured to point to your App Insights instance/workspace. All requests will be tracked, as well as dependant calls to MongoDB or other APIs (if configured), exceptions & error will also be logged

[This article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/app-insights-nodejs) has more information on monitoring Node.js with App Insights

### Weather Details
Enable this by setting `WEATHER_API_KEY`

This will require a API key from Dark Sky, you can [sign up for free and get one here](https://darksky.net/dev). The page uses a browser API for geolocation to fetch the user's location.  
However, the `geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` browser API will only work when the site is served via HTTPS or from localhost. As a fallback, weather for London, UK will be show if the current position can not be obtained

### User Authentication with Azure AD
Enable this by setting `AAD_APP_ID`, `AAD_APP_SECRET` and `AAD_REDIRECT_URL_BASE`

This uses [Passport.js and the Azure AD plug-in](https://github.com/AzureAD/passport-azure-ad) to authenticate via OIDC. In addition the user account page shows details & photo retrieved from the Microsoft Graph API

You will need to register an app in your Azure AD tennant. [See this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app). Make sure you enable the options for "Access Tokens" and "ID Tokens" in the Authentication settings. Add a secret to your app and use the app's ID & secret value in `AAD_APP_ID` & `AAD_APP_SECRET`

`AAD_REDIRECT_URL_BASE` should be the base URL of where your app is running, e.g. `http://localhost:3000` or `https://example.com`. It should start with `http://` or `https://`. This is used by the login flow to redirect back to the app, the path `/auth/openid/return` will be appended to this value to form the complete redirect URL

### Todo App
Enable this by setting `TODO_MONGO_CONNSTR`

A mini todo & task tracking app can be enabled if a MongoDB backend is provided and a connection string to access it. This feature is primarily to show database dependency detection and tracking in App Insights

The default database name is `todoDb` but you can change this by setting `TODO_MONGO_DB`

You can stand up MongoDB in a container instance or in Cosmos DB (using the Mongo API). Note. When using Cosmos DB and the *per database provisioned RU/s* option, you must manually create the collection called `todos` in the relevant database and set the shard key to `_id`

# Configuration 
The following configuration environmental variables are supported, however none are mandatory. These can be set directly or when running locally will be picked up from an `.env` file if it is present. A sample `.env` file called `.env.sample` is provided for you to copy 

If running in an Azure Web App, all of these values can be injected as application settings in Azure.

| Environmental Variable         | Default | Description                                                                                      |

| TODO_MONGO_CONNSTR             | *none*  | Connect to specified MongoDB instance, when set the Todo feature will be enabled in the menu bar |
| TODO_MONGO_DB                  | todoDb  | Name of the database in MongoDB to use (optional)                                                |
| APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY | *none*  | Enable Application Insights monitoring                                                           |
| WEATHER_API_KEY                | *none*  | DarkSky weather API key. [Info here](https://darksky.net/dev)                                    |
| AAD_APP_ID                     | *none*  | Application ID of app registered in Azure AD                                                     |
| AAD_APP_SECRET                 | *none*  | Secret / password of app registered in Azure AD                                                  |
| AAD_REDIRECT_URL_BASE          | *none*  | Hostname/domain where app is running                                                             |


# Azure Templates
ARM templates for deployment to Azure are provided. To get started quickly you can deploy the app as a Azure Container Instance using [this template](https://github.com/benc-uk/azure-arm/tree/master/container-instances/linux-container), and use `bencuk/nodejs-demoapp` as the image name and `3000` as the port
